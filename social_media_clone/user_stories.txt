**Title:** Follow Another User
**As a:** Registered User
**I want to:** Click a "Follow" button on another user's profile
**So that:** I can see their posts in my news feed and stay updated on their activity.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
* AC1: When I visit another user's profile, a "Follow" button is visible if I am not already following them.
* AC2: Clicking the "Follow" button changes its state to "Following".
* AC3: The user I followed is added to my "Following" list.
* AC4: My follower count on my profile remains unchanged; the followed user's follower count increments by one.
* AC5: Posts from the followed user start appearing in my news feed (chronologically or based on algorithm).
* AC6: If I am already following the user, the button shows "Following" and clicking it initiates the "Unfollow" action (covered in a separate story perhaps).
