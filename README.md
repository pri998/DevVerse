**DevVerse: AI-Powered Virtual Development Pod**
  "Bringing intelligence to requirements — and speed to solutions."
  
  **DevVerse** is an AI-powered assistant that automates the transformation of plain English RFPs (Request for Proposals) into structured, implementation-ready development assets — all through an intelligent pipeline of role-based autonomous agents and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).


What is DevVerse?
  DevVerse mimics a real-world project team using intelligent agents like:
  
  🧑‍💼 Business Analyst Agent – Extracts user stories
  🎨 Design Agent – Generates UI/UX components & architecture
  💻 Developer Agent – Produces backend code & database structure
  ✅ Tester Agent – Builds test cases based on user stories and code
  These agents collaborate to convert an RFP into project artifacts — automatically, intelligently, and instantly.

Problem We Solve:
  RFPs are often written in unstructured, plain English.
  Converting them into usable formats (user stories, UI layouts, test cases, etc.) takes time, manual effort, and domain expertise.
  Scaling this process across domains like finance, e-commerce, or healthcare becomes inefficient.

Our Solution:
  DevVerse automates this workflow using a smart, modular pipeline:
  🧠 Embedding                     Creation	RFP is encoded into semantic vectors
  🔍 Vector Search (ChromaDB)	      Retrieves domain-relevant templates
  🧩 Agent Collaboration	          Agents extract and generate structured outputs
  🧾 LLM Response	                  Final context goes to LLM (Gemini-1.5-flash) to generate artifacts

Tech Stack:
  Frontend	-> Streamlit
  Backend	  -> Python, CrewAI
  LLM       -> API	Gemini-1.5-flash
  Vector DB	 -> ChromaDB
  Embeddings -> Sentence Transformers
  Agent Framework	-> CrewAI, Prompt Chaining

Agents in Action:
  Each agent plays a defined role in the pipeline:
  🧑‍💼 Business Analyst Agent
  Extracts domain keywords and requirements
  Generates user stories based on RFP understanding
  🎨 Design Agent
  Selects UI layouts from template pool
  Builds hierarchy and architecture diagrams
  💻 Developer Agent
  Suggests database schema and backend module layout
  (Extendable to generate code skeletons)
  ✅ Tester Agent
  Derives test cases from user stories and functions
  Suggests automation test structure
